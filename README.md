Repro Arcade Components

This repo has arcade components that I've reproduced in eagle/kicad from publically available schematics or designed myself from scratch. They come with no support or guarantees and are released as public domain.

Usually these are things i've reproduced while repairing a board. The idea is for people to be able to repair their arcade machines cheaply. 

## Seibu HB-41

Taken from Gurudumps schematic (Taken from https://gurudumps.otenko.com/re/ ) but as there was no gerbers or shop to buy the board I spent an hour producing a board layout for me (all the components have the same labels) and designed the board to be preassembled on one side by JLCPCB.
